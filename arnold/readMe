The ocean shader consists of two nodes:
bs_Ocean:
	A vector displacement shader generates the ocean waves.
bs_oceanFoamMask:
	A float output shader, outputs Black/White mask at the places where the foam and splashes should be
	emitted from.

Known issues:
	* Only one instance of the two shader can be found in the same scene! Adding two bs_Ocean will cause
	  Render crash at the end of the frame rendering "when reach AiEnd()".


*Mods by John C.  (redpawFX) 
	Modified to put both shaders into one compile, added  fairly generic linux makeFile and fixed some  naming conflicts.
